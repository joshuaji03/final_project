# [final_project](https://joshuaji03.github.io/final_project/index.html)
This is a final project created for GEOG 458

I have created a map that plots the records of police violences from **2013 to 2019**

This is an interactive map that allows users to choose the categories they want to view. I have included three choices, police violence based on age, ethnicity and gender.

The play bar is the biggest feature of the map, it allows users to view the police violence progress through days. The play bar also shows the date that the incident happened. Last but not least, the progress bar allows users to accelerate or slow down the animation of the flashing data points.

Used libraries
- carto.js
- leaflet.js
